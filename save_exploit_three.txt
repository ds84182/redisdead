If you set the current script for oak to 0x1E, you jump straight into a controlled part of WRAM (Save is loaded into that area)
(0xD72E) (0x4B64) (0x4B28) (we could do D7CD if we do the jump table at 0x4BA2 (middle of event flags))
(Execution in save file starts at 0x25a3+(0xd72e-0xd2f7) 0x29DA

If you use index 0x38 (map pallettown), execution starts at 0xD361 (player coordinates, 0x25a3+(0xd361-0xd2f7) 0x260D)

Exploit Success!

The game jumps and starts executing the player's coords, which are (for the time being) 0xC3 0x00 0x01, which restarts the game.
The player coords can be a jump into loaded box memory, which will start the exploit script.
There will be some sort of "return to game" functionality.
Initial payload will be in SRAM Bank 0 after HOF data (0xb858, 0x1858 in save file).
The payload will start execution from an unused SRAM bank.

(SRAM TARGET, ID: 6D ADDR: A7CC)
We can also use a jump target directly to SRAM Bank 0, but we need to make sure that Hall of Fame data does not get written there.
We do that by setting the number of HOF completions to 0

------

With the current exploit, we use the following:
In pallet town:
(WRAM TARGET, ID: 15 ADDR: DB3E)
This jumps into Box data, which isn't overwritten much.

We can then hook into execution everywhere on the overworld using
wNPCMovementScriptPointerTableNum and friends.
However, Pallet disables this (but not anymore after the exploit)
and Pewter disables it.
However, Pewter's jump tables have an errant entry that also
jumps into Box Data.
(WRAM TARGET, ID: 0E ADDR: D755)
Initial Payload should have enough space to jump back up to
D72E and begin exploit execution.

------

For hooking execution outside of pallet and pewter, we can use
wNPCMovement stuff. The code uses a table of tables. However,
you can specify the ROM bank the secondary table is in, and you
can overflow out of the table indicies.
Using a tool, I found:
(WRAM TARGET, ID: 17 ADDR: DB3E TABLE: 00 BANK: 10 (46442))
A target that jumps directly to the initial payload.

So, the code can install a table with the ID of 1 (ID is dec)
a function of 0x17, and a bank of 0x10 to gain per frame
execution again.
