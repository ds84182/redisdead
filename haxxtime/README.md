# sramhax (codename "haxxtime")

sramhax is a piece of code that runs from SRAM that is able to persist across restarts and run in the background. This directory contains the main menu of sramhax. initial_payload contains the actual code that executes sramhax.

Currently this shows a fly menu that allows you to fly anywhere without a Pokemon that knows fly.
